## Project Description
The Sales Calculator is a Java program that computes the monthly income for a salesperson based on their sales amount. The program includes a base salary and applies a commission based on a tiered structure. The commission rates increase as the sales amount increases, making it a useful tool for understanding how sales performance affects earnings.

### Commission Tiers:
- Tier 1: 8% commission on sales up to $5,000.
- Tier 2: 10% commission on sales between $5,000 and $10,000.
- Tier 3: 12% commission on sales above $10,000.

### Base Salary:
- Fixed base salary of $5,000.
